# Upstream Baseline

This file records the pinned upstream commit that T3 Trade' fork was built
from, per the Git strategy repository model. See `SPEC_EVIDENCE.md` for the
separately tracked pin of the requirements/spec commit this baseline's
acceptance criteria were checked against.

## How this was pinned

1. Cloned `https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code.git` with
   `--single-branch --branch main`.
2. Renamed the cloned remote to `upstream` and disabled its push URL.
3. Added the writable fork `https://github.com/TaraxioT/t3trade.git`
   as `origin`.
4. Configured `upstream` to fetch only `main`
   (`+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/upstream/main`).
5. Recorded `upstream/main` at `a8e05cbb92633a1351529f2bc402071f615e5051`
   as the accepted baseline and created the immutable annotated tag
   `upstream-base/2026-07-29-a8e05cbb` pointing at it.
6. `main` on the fork descends directly from this commit; no trading code
   has been added yet.

## Updating this file

Each future accepted upstream sync batch (see `SYNC_RUNBOOK.md`) must:

- Add a new row (or superseding section) recording the new pinned SHA, tag,
  and date — do not silently overwrite history.
- Create a new immutable `upstream-base/YYYY-MM-DD-<shortSHA>` tag; never
  reuse or move an existing tag.
- Reference the rehearsal/production sync PR that performed the merge.
