# The published app is not notarized by Apple, and macOS refuses to open a
# non-notarized app that arrived through a browser — the download carries a
# quarantine flag, and Gatekeeper reports the app as "damaged" rather than as
# unsigned. Nothing is wrong with the app; the flag is the whole problem.
#
# This script downloads the same DMG the website links to, copies the app to
# /Applications, and removes that flag, which is exactly what the manual
# instructions ask the user to do by hand. It installs nothing else, needs no
# password, and touches no system settings.
