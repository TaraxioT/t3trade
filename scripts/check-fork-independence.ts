/** Guards against a future upstream sync silently reintroducing a live
    dependency on pingdotgg/t3code's own infrastructure (e.g. a hardcoded
    update/release endpoint). Scans non-test source files under apps/,
    packages/, scripts/, and infra/ for the upstream repo URL.

    Test fixtures that use "pingdotgg/t3code" as an example GitHub URL (git
    URL parsing tests, PR-link tests, etc) are expected and excluded by the
    *.test.ts(x) filter below. Docs recording the pinned baseline
    (docs/upstream/*.md) are expected to name the upstream repo. The mobile
    showcase's simulated demo project (see PATCH_LEDGER.md) is the one
    known non-test, non-doc reference, and is explicitly allow-listed. */
