/**
 * Reading every per-order status out of an `/exchange` response - spec §17.2
 * step 4, §17.1.
 *
 * §17.1 is blunt about this: never treat a batch as atomic. A grouped
 * `normalTpsl` request that returns HTTP 200 can still contain a rejected
 * child, an untriggered child, or a child the exchange dropped. The only way
 * to know is to read each row, so this module exists to make that reading
 * total and testable rather than a set of optional-chained guesses at a call
 * site.
 *
 * Two shapes have to survive here.
 *
 * The response envelope nests the rows under `response.data.statuses`, not
 * `response.statuses`. Reading only the shallow path yields an empty list on
 * every real order response, and "no statuses" is indistinguishable from "no
 * orders accepted" — a silent way to believe an entry never landed while it is
 * filling. Both paths are read.
 *
 * The rows themselves are a mix. Some are bare strings ("success",
 * "waitingForFill", "waitingForTrigger"); the rest are single-key objects
 * naming the outcome: `{resting: {oid, cloid}}`, `{filled: {totalSz, avgPx,
 * oid, cloid}}`, `{error: "..."}`. Anything unrecognised is reported as an
 * error rather than skipped — an unreadable status is not a passing one.
 *
