/**
 * Deterministic client order id (cloid) - spec §15.5.
 *
 * `derive16Bytes(missionId, executionSequence, actionType)` produces a stable
 * 16-byte cloid so a retry of the same action carries the same cloid.
 * Identical inputs give identical cloids; different inputs must not collide.
 *
 * **A cloid is a correlation id, not an idempotency key.** Hyperliquid enforces
 * cloid uniqueness only among *resting* orders, and a marketable IOC never
 * rests — resubmitting one is verified live (`executionLive.test.ts`) to open a
 * second order that fills again. What the stable cloid buys is reconciliation:
 * the Info API echoes it back on the order and its fills, so a fill can be
 * joined to the execution record that caused it. Retry safety belongs to the
 * caller — `HyperliquidExecutionService` refuses to resubmit a record that has
 * already reached the exchange.
 *
 * Algorithm (owner-approved): SHA-256 over the concatenated inputs, taking
 * the first 16 bytes, hex-encoded as a `0x`-prefixed 34-character lowercase
 * string — the Hyperliquid wire convention for `cloid` (16 bytes / 128 bits,
 * `0x` + 32 hex chars, validated by the exchange as `len(cloid[2:]) == 32`).
 *
 * Format note (Task 4 finding): a prior version returned a bare 32-char hex
 * string with no `0x` prefix. The live Gate E entry (oid 57307761690) was
 * accepted, but reading it back showed the exchange stored `"cloid": null` —
 * the bare form was silently dropped, so retry-deduplication rested entirely
 * on local idempotency-key convergence, never on exchange-side cloid match.
 * The `0x` prefix is now applied at this single boundary so one
 * representation flows everywhere: the wire order, the DB column, the
 * reconciler's join, and the UI slice.
 *
