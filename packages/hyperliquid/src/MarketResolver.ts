/**
 * Hyperliquid market resolver - spec §10.6 + §13.
 *
 * Resolves the canonical market identifiers (asset index, size decimals, max
 * leverage, availability) for a perp symbol from live `metaAndAssetCtxs`
 * metadata. The asset index is the position of the coin in `meta.universe`,
 * which is the same position in `assetCtxs` — it MUST be resolved at runtime
 * and never hard-coded (ETH is not always index 1).
 *
 * The resolved metadata is cached in a `Ref` and re-fetched when it is older
 * than `MARKET_FRESHNESS.assetContextStaleAfterMillis` (§13: 5s). Resolution is
 * an O(n) scan of the cached universe by name; for the POC's small testnet
 * universe this is cheaper than maintaining a parallel map.
