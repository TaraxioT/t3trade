/**
 * Testnet lab authority defaults — the mandate a ~$100 account can actually

 *
 * `pocAuthorityDefaults` is written for the spec's $1,000 worked example and
 * does not scale down. On $100 it yields $2 of planned risk per position, and
 * $2 does not survive contact with the accounting: a $300 entry already spends
 * $0.75 on the 25 bps stop-slippage reserve and $0.30 on the two 5 bps fee
 * estimates before a single dollar of stop distance is bought. Entries come
 * back refused as unviable, or the harness compresses the stop until it sits
 * inside the noise and gets taken out by a wick.
 *
 * The four numbers, and why each is where it is (C = allocated capital):
 *
 * - `maximumLeverage: 20` — the operator's stated testnet ceiling. ETH on
 *   Hyperliquid testnet allows 25x, so this is T3's limit rather than the
 *   exchange's. Note that preview measures leverage as notional ÷ *mandate*,
 *   not notional ÷ margin, so in practice the gross cap below binds first;
 *   this number is the documented ceiling, not the working constraint.
 * - `maximumGrossNotionalUsd: 8 × C` — $800 on $100. At 20x that is $40 of
 *   isolated margin, leaving most of the account as headroom. Sized to what
 *   the loss budget can protect rather than to what the margin allows: the
 *   ~$2,000 the exchange would permit is notional the $35 budget cannot stand
 *   behind.
 * - `maximumCumulativeLossUsd: 0.35 × C` — $35 on $100. Roughly four full
 *   per-position risks, so a losing streak ends the mission rather than the
 *   account.
 * - `maximumPlannedRiskPerPositionUsd: 0.07 × C` — $7 on $100. At the largest
 *   allowed $800 entry (0.267 ETH near $3,000) that funds a stop 0.9% away;
 *   at a more typical $400 entry, 1.75%. Both are real distances on a 1m
 *   momentum timeframe, which is the whole test.
 *
 * Everything else — isolated margin only, reversal off, the risk policy — is
 * the POC mandate unchanged. This widens size, not permissions.
