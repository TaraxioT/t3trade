/**
 * The numbers the strategy is allowed to argue about, in one versioned place.
 *
 * The thresholds here decide whether a setup reads as a trade: how decisive a
 * directional score has to be, how much a range is worth working, how close to
 * a boundary an entry counts as a boundary entry, when a session stops taking
 * new entries, and how long a losing streak sits out. They were true constants
 * — some in `marketStructure.ts`, some written only into playbook prose — so the same
 * value could be tightened in the arithmetic and left stale in the doctrine
 * the harness actually reads, and nothing would notice.
 *
 * What a trade costs is deliberately not among them any more: plan 29 step 3.1
 * took the entry cost multiples out, and cost survives as context the
 * observation carries, never as a gate.
 *
 * Collecting them changes no behaviour: {@link TRADING_POLICY_V1} is the
 * numbers as they already were, to the digit. What it buys is the ability to
 * state a candidate as a value rather than a diff, replay both over the same
 * fixtures (see `./replay.ts`), and ship the change only if the evidence says
 * so — which is the whole discipline this module exists to make possible.
 *
 * These are policy, not safety. Nothing here relaxes a §16 gate, a stop
 * requirement, or a risk ceiling; those are not calibrated, they are kept.
