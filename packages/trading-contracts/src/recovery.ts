 * as one undifferentiated refusal, and the model's only available response to
 * all three was to stand down. Two of the three would have worked on a second
 * attempt half a second later.
 *
 * So a failure carries two more things than its message: whether trying again
 * could plausibly change the answer, and what the harness should do instead if
 * it could not. Neither is a guess about the market. Both are properties of the
 * error itself, which is why they are derived here rather than reasoned about
