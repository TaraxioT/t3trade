/**
 * Getting out — the one tool for everything that removes or protects exposure.
 *
 * Exiting used to be a shape of `trading_execute`: the harness hand-built an
 * intent with an action type of `reduce` or `close`, a side, a size, a limit
 * price, a strategy version, an authority version, a lease-owning run and a
 * monotonic sequence — the same eight-field ceremony an entry demands, for an
 * action that has no discretion in it at all. Every one of those fields is
 * either something the server already knows or something only the canonical
 * position can answer: the side of an exit is the opposite of what is held, and
 * the size of a close is all of it.
 *
 * So `trading_exit` takes almost nothing: an `action`, and only the fields
 * that action cannot derive. And getting out is the one thing that must never
 * fail for a reason belonging to getting in, which is why it does not share
 * the entry path's input at all.

 * it is. They are one tool with an `action` because the model was choosing
 * between four descriptions of the same situation before it could act on it.
