 * Mission and strategy tool contracts - spec §14.3.

 * silently overwriting current state.
 *
 * §14.3 publishes `TradingPublishPlanInput` and
 * `TradingPublishPlanResult` in full; both are mirrored here
 * field-for-field.
 *
 * Scope note: §14.1/§14.2/§14.4-§14.7 name their tools but publish no input or
 * output schemas, and execution is out of scope for this phase. Only the two
 * §14.3 mission tools are modeled here.
