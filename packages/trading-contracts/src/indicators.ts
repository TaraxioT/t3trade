/**
 * On-demand indicator readings for `trading_look`'s `candles` scope.
 *
 * The model pulls the indicator it is reasoning with — `ema(9)`, `rsi(14)` —
 * instead of deriving it from raw bars in context or receiving a fixed panel
 * it may not read. The server computes on bars it already fetched for the
 * candle read, so a reading costs no extra exchange call.
 *
 * Each reading reports `value` (over every fetched bar, the in-progress one
 * included) and `previous` (the same computation one bar back). The pair is
 * what a crossover or slope check needs: `ema(9) > ema(21)` now and not one
 * bar ago IS the cross, with no series riding back in the response.
 *
 * The pair the `ema_cross` playbook actually trades is `EMA_FAST_PERIOD` /
 * `EMA_SLOW_PERIOD` from `./marketStructure.ts` — 9 and 21 — and the
 * structure read already serves it as its own `ema` block, cross age and
 * separation included. Nothing here recomputes that: these readings are for
 * the periods the structure read does NOT serve, and every example below names
 * the traded pair so a request modelled on one is never pointed at a pair the
 * doctrine has no gate for.
