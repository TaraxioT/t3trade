 * and the thesis is the thing to reconsider. `profit_target` means the runtime
 * armed a `pnl_above` watch at the strategy's declared profit target while the
 * mission holds a position — a wake from it is a decision point: bank the win
 * (close, or reduce and keep a runner) if momentum is fading, or extend to the
 * ladder's next rung by republishing with a fresh basis if it is not.
 *
 * `stop_proximity` means the runtime armed a `price_cross` one ATR ahead of the
 * resting stop while the mission holds a position. A wake from it is the
 * designed moment to decide the stop deliberately — tighten, hold, or exit —
 * before the exchange decides instead.
 *
 * `stop_decision` means the runtime armed a `pnl_below` watch at ~70% of the
 * planned loss at the resting stop. A wake from it asks one question — thesis
 * broken, or noise? The answers are hold, tighten legally, or exit better
 * than the stop; the exchange stop stays resting as the backstop.
 *
 * `wake_retry` means this watch is a replacement for one that fired and was
 * consumed by a wake that then failed to reach the harness. The condition it
 * carries is the same one the harness armed; the reason records that the
 * original firing was lost, so a wake from it is not a second crossing.
 *
 * `prediction_horizon` and `prediction_invalidation` are the two the runtime
 * arms from a published plan's projection: the clock running out on the read,
 * and the level at which the read is wrong. Together they are what lets a
 * mission publish a prediction and then genuinely sleep — the pair is the only
 * thing that has to wake it before the market has said anything new. They are

 * "cross above 1850" armed while price is already 1860 is not upside coverage;
 * it is a condition that was true before it was written.
 *
 * PnL watches cover a side too, when the position's direction is known. A
 * `pnl_above` is a level in dollars on the winning side, `pnl_below` and
 * `pnl_giveback` are levels on the losing side, and the evaluator re-reads
 * reconciled unrealised PnL on every sweep — so a long with a loss line and a
 * target armed hears both ways it can move. Which price direction each maps to
 * comes from the sign of `positionSize`; without it they cover nothing, because
 * "winning" has no meaning.
 *
 * A confirmed exchange-native stop covering the whole position also counts as
 * losing-side coverage: the position cannot run through it without the exchange
 * acting, and the exchange acting produces a `position_update`.
 *
 * `order_update` and `position_update` on their own cover nothing. They fire on
 * a change in size — real events, but a position whose only armed watches are
 * those can watch its own mark run away and never hear about it, which is
 * exactly the session this rule exists because of.
