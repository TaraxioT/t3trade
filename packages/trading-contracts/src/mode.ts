 * job changes from _decide_ to _execute faithfully and report deviations_.

 * would be a second copy of a fact the instruction already states, written
 * once at mission creation and free to disagree with the words the operator
 * actually typed — and the instruction is what the model reads. Deriving it
 * keeps one source, costs no migration, and makes the rule inspectable: the
 * mandate that produced the mode is right there in the same read.

 * momentum on ETH" is how someone says _lean momentum, use your judgement_,
 * and reading it as a standing order turns a discretionary session into one
 * that stands aside from every non-momentum setup. "Execute", "run" and
