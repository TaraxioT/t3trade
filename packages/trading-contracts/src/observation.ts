 * - `mission`: mandate, authority, plan, watches, pending executions.
 * - `retrospect`: what the mission has BELIEVED — plan history, journal,
 *   target calibration. Split out of `mission` because it is the half that
 *   grows: a turn reacting to a level that just fired was paying for its own
 *   back-catalogue on every read.
