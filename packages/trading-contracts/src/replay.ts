/**
 * Replaying a policy over bars that already happened.
 *
 * The assessment's rule for this step is that no threshold ships on a trade
 * count. That rule needs somewhere to be enforced, because "we loosened the
 * range multiple and got more trades" is both true and worthless on its own —
 * every loosening produces more trades, and the only question is whether the
 * extra ones paid.
 *
 * So a candidate policy is run over recorded windows the way the live loop
 * would read them: the setup finder sees the history and nothing else, the
 * outcome comes from bars it never saw, and the comparison against the shipped
 * baseline holds net expectancy, drawdown, fee share, and adverse excursion —
 * with the count reported alongside and never counted as evidence.
 *
 * Two honest limits. The fill is assumed at the last close of the history, so
 * this measures the setup and the thresholds, not the execution path; and a
 * fixture is a window somebody chose, so a replay that looks good is a reason to
 * run a testnet soak, never a substitute for one.
