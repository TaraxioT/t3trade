/**
 * The trading surfaces a mission-bound thread carries.
 *
 * Two mounts, deliberately separate (§14.2 / §13 / §10):
 *
 * - {@link MissionThreadBanners} is chrome. The exception banners that sit with
 *   the strip above the thread, for as long as the mission is armed or exposed,
 *   so a feed or staleness warning stays on screen without hunting.
 * - {@link MissionThreadCards} is content. The execution *events* — an order
 *   intent while one is in flight, the fill receipts, the completion summary —
 *   render at the end of the message timeline and scroll with it.
 *
 * The live position is deliberately not here. It is state, not an event: it
 * changes every reconcile, and a changing number parked in a scrolling log
 * reads as a fact recorded at the point you scrolled past. It lives in the
 * pinned `MissionLivePanel` instead, which is also where its entry price and
 * size stopped being said twice — once by the position card, once by the fill
 * receipt directly beneath it.
 *
 * The split is the point. A pinned band that grows with every fill covers the
 * conversation it is supposed to annotate; the prototype puts the cards inline
 * in the thread and keeps only the strip fixed, and so does this.
 *
 * Everything here is read from the projection. These components hold no state
 * of their own and show nothing the projection does not say — there is no
 * placeholder row waiting for data that has not arrived, because a row of
 * em-dashes reads as a broken feed rather than as an absence.
 *
 * @module MissionThreadPanel
