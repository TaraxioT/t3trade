/**
 * The persistent mission strip (§14.7 risk chrome).
 *
 * One strip, two mounts: pinned to the top of the workspace list, and pinned
 * under the chat header of the thread the mission is bound to. Both read the
 * same derivation, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about what a mission is
 * doing — which they would within a release if each drew its own.
 *
 * The way out is always one click. While exposure exists the primary action is
 * close-and-stop: never a menu, never two steps, and never dependent on the
 * harness being alive to serve it.
 *
 * It is exactly one line tall, at every width. Chrome that grows is chrome that
 * eats the conversation, so the detail slots truncate and nothing here wraps:
 * the strip costs the thread 40px whatever the mission is doing.
 *
 * @module MissionStripBar
