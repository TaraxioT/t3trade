//
// The one pinned trading surface, docked directly above the composer. It
// replaces four separate ones — the position-gated chart dock, the plan card,
// the armed-conditions card, and the timeline's position card — which used to
// stack as boxes saying overlapping things, each consuming timeline height
// whether or not it was the thing the operator was looking at.
//
// Four explicit states, driven purely by the projection:
//
//   planning  no strategy yet          → chart + mark, "Analysing the market…"
//   armed     strategy, flat, watching → chart + condition levels + plan summary
//   live      position open            → the same, plus P&L and the held figures
//   complete  mission finished         → the net result, kept for good (plan 27 H1)
//
// It is THREE panes of glass, floating clear of each other and of the composer
// below: the chart card on the left, closed by the risk/reward bar; the readout
// card on the right — the side chip and the P&L, the progress rule, the thesis,
// the grid of figures the exposure is made of, and the armed watches; and under
// both of them, spanning the full width, the status bar that says in a sentence
// what the mission is doing, with the ambient facts trailing right.
// All three carry the composer's material, the same surface tint, blur,
// saturation and hairline outline, plus a 1px inner highlight along the top
// edge so each reads as a lit pane rather than a painted rectangle.
//
// One box holding everything was the first attempt and it was wrong: a price
// chart and a column of prices divided by a single hairline read as one flat
// table, and the eye had nothing to tell it where the picture ended and the
// instrument began. The gaps do that. Below `lg` the two cards stack, each
// keeping its own edges, and the bar stays under them.
//
// Proportion is the point of the row. At the panel's own width (6xl, set at
// its call site in ChatView) the readout takes a fixed 400px and the chart
// takes everything else, which is about 64/35 — a picture with an instrument
// beside it, not two columns splitting the difference. The chart is 440px tall
// because the price line is the one thing here that is read as a shape.
//
// ONE line in the picture. The chart draws closes at the runtime's own
// interval, and nothing else: no candle bodies, no moving averages. Three
// curves in one frame — price, fast EMA, slow EMA — read as three subjects,
// and the two smooth ones won, which is the opposite of the intent. Everything
// else on the chart is a level the plan drew across that line.
//
// Every figure on it is set in the mono face, at one of three sizes: the P&L
// at 24px because it is the number being read, the exposure figures and the
// watch rows at 12px because they are read down a list, and the labels that
// name them at 10.5px. Prose — the plan's thesis, the disclosure — stays in
// the UI face. Mixing a proportional face into a column of prices is what made
// four rows of numbers read as four unrelated facts.
//
// Density is held down by cutting whole objects, not by shrinking type. Three
// things went in the pass that made this match its reference: the schedule
// strip, whose every pill named a price the chart was already drawing a rule
// at; the strip of recent wake pills, which was three amber capsules saying a
// watch had fired, on a panel whose entire subject is watches; and the EMA
// pair with its legend. What is left is a picture, a column of figures, a list
// of conditions and a sentence.
//
// A number still appears at most twice, and only when the two say different
// things: P&L, ROI and progress are header figures and the grid never repeats
// them, while entry and mark ARE in both places — as a tag on the shape and as
// a cell in the column — because the gutter says where and the cell says what.
// Hold time, funding and the day's change are true but not acted on, so they
// sit in the ambient line at the foot; the exact threshold behind each watch is
// a hover; everything the plan said is one disclosure away. Exceptions get
// louder, not quieter: a stop covering only part of the position takes a cell
// of its own, in the loss tone, because that is the difference between a
// bounded loss and an open one.
//
// `planning`, `armed` and `live` draw the same surface; what differs is how
// much of it there is anything to say about. Planning has a market, a mark, a
// candle series and a run history from its first turn, and none of that needs a
// published strategy — but it has no thesis, no levels and no target, so its
// grid holds a mark and a countdown, and the checklist, the risk/reward bar and
// the plan disclosure are absent rather than empty. Nothing on the surface is
// invented to fill the space a plan will later take.
//
// The chart's gate used to be "a
// position exists", which meant a mission spent its whole waiting phase showing
// nothing at all — and waiting is most of a mission's life. The plan's levels
// used to be gated the other way, on `armed`, so they all vanished the instant
// a fill landed. Both gates are gone: the levels change (armed draws what it is
// waiting for, live draws what it is holding against, and a PnL watch resolves
// to a price once there is an exposure to divide by), the surface does not.
//
// Everything here is read from the projection. The chart feed
// (`useTradingMarketChart`, 15s poll) supplies candles + funding/OI/volume; the
// mission poll (3s) supplies the freshest mark via `mission.marketPrice`, so the
// pill and the chart can never show two different marks. No figure is invented:
// a missing denominator omits a figure rather than guessing.
