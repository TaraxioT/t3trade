 *
 * The claim worth testing is the collapse, not the DDL. Rows written under the
 * old key are already in every live database — the mission this was found on
 * has a pair 67ms apart — and calibration reads them as two trades unless this
 * migration puts them back together. The other half of the claim matters just
 * as much: a mission's genuinely separate trades must survive it.
