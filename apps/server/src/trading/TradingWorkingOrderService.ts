/**
 * TradingWorkingOrderService — plan 29 step 2.4, the order working loop.
 *
 * A patient entry is a post-only ALO the wake placed at the near side, and a
 * post-only order only fills when the market comes to it. Unowned, it does one
 * of two bad things: rests at a price the market has moved away from until the
 * wake's approval is stale, or fills exactly when the market runs through it —
 * the adverse-selection failure the plan's risk note names. This service is
 * the owner. On every watchdog pass it gives a resting unfilled entry one of
 * four answers:
 *
 *   - nothing, while it is young and still at the near side;
 *   - a re-price: cancel and re-place at the CURRENT near side, still post-only,
 *     same size, same side, same stop;
 *   - a cross, once the stated max wait is up: cancel and take the urgency-
 *     "now" path (a marketable IOC) — the moment the wake already approved;
 *   - an abandon, when none of those is possible: the order left the book, the
 *     mission stopped wanting new exposure, or the replacement failed. What
 *     rests is cancelled and the model is told in one line.
 *
 * The exit lane (the audited risk fix this half adds): a model-initiated
 * `patient` exit — a `close`/`reduce` the exit tool rested as a reduce-only
 * ALO — had the mirror problem with no owner at all: no re-price, no cross
 * after a wait, no withdrawal, bounded only by the resting stop. The same
 * pass now owns it with the semantics inverted, because exits are about
 * LEAVING:
 *
 *   - a position is what an exit NEEDS — position gone means it filled (the
 *     fill channel reports that) or it should be withdrawn;
 *   - a suspended mission keeps working its exit: an exit resting is exposure
 *     coming off, and withdrawing it would put exposure back on. Only the
 *     terminal statuses withdraw (the reactor's retirement path owns that);
 *   - a plan revision does not retract an exit. The publish aftermath
 *     retracts resting ENTRIES; an exit is the model's deliberate choice to
 *     leave patiently (the same reasoning that made the take-profit loop
 *     preserve these orders, commit 580c788b6), and the model has the cancel
 *     tool when it changes its mind.
 *
 * The take-profit loop must not be double-managed from here, and is not: see
 * `readNewestAcceptedExit` for how the two lanes of resting reduce-only ALOs
 * are told apart.
 *
 * It is a stateless reconcile in the same sense `TradingProtectionService` is:
 * state is read from canonical exchange state (position + open orders via the
 * master wallet) and from the execution records the submit path already
 * writes. No new tables, no loop-local memory, no migration. Age comes from
 * the records' own timestamps, so a server restart cannot reset a wait.
 *
 * The ordering rule is the stop reconcile's mirror image, and the difference
 * is load-bearing. Overlapping reduce-only STOPS are harmless (they cannot
 * open exposure), so the stop path places the replacement first and cancels
 * the stale one after. Overlapping ENTRIES are double exposure, so this
 * service cancels first, confirms the cancel from canonical state, and only
 * then places. The gap in between holds no position — the entry was unfilled —
 * so the one invariant that must never break ("the moment of fill must never
 * find itself without its stop child") is kept by never placing an entry
 * without its grouped reduce-only stop child beside it. The exit lane keeps
 * the same cancel-first-then-place ordering even though two resting
 * reduce-only exits are only queue contention, never double exposure: keeping
 * records and book one-to-one is what the lineage walk assumes, and the
 * transient co-existence of the exit with the resting stop or the plan's
 * take-profit is tolerated for the same reason the stop reconcile tolerates
 * it — reduce-only orders cannot open exposure.
 *
 * Cancelling a grouped entry parent takes its linked stop child with it (the
 * `normalTpsl` semantics §17.1 documents and §17.3 relies on), which is why
 * every replacement re-places the pair together rather than only the parent.
 * A reduce-only exit carries no stop child — there is nothing to protect
 * against an order that only ever shrinks the position.
 *
 * Exhaustion is not re-evaluated here: §16.4's block already cancels every
 * mission-owned increasing order the moment the budget exhausts, and this
 * loop's vanish branch is what reports the loss of the entry afterwards.
 *
 * Hyperliquid's Chase order type is deliberately not used: it is a browser-tab
 * feature capped at five active orders and is not reachable server-side.
