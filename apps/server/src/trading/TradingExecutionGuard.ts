/**
 * TradingExecutionGuard — §16.4 exhaustion enforcement + reduce-only close.
 *
 * When the cumulative-loss budget is exhausted (`remainingCumulativeLossUsd ≤
 * 0`), §16.4 mandates: cancel position-increasing orders, block new entries/
 * scale-ins/reversals/re-entry, preserve valid reduce-only protection, and
 * set the mission to `blocked` with reason `cumulative_loss_limit`. The
 * harness `trading_resume_mission` is REJECTED while blocked — only an
 * explicit user resume (after revalidation) clears it.
 *
 * Reduce-only close (§17.2) submits a reduce-only IOC that brings the
 * position to flat, then reconciles.
