/**
 * TradingTurnCoordinator - the single gate between an observed event and a
 * started run, spec §12.3, and the wake path that resumes the provider session.
 *
 * It runs the §12.3 pre-run checks in their listed order before acquiring the
 * decision lease, and returns one of three outcomes so a caller can tell
 * whether a run actually started, was queued behind an active one, or was
 * blocked. Only one run may own the mission decision lease at a time; the
 * `idx_trading_harness_runs_one_active_per_mission` unique partial index
 * (migration 035) makes a concurrent second insert a unique violation, which
 * the coordinator catches and reports as `queued_behind_active_run`.
 *
 * On a `started` outcome the coordinator builds the bounded `TradingHarnessWakeup`
 * via `TradingWakeupComposer`, serializes it into the resumed turn's message
 * text, and dispatches `thread.turn.start` via `OrchestrationEngineService`. It
 * does NOT call `ProviderService` directly: dispatch is the only sanctioned way
 * for trading code to resume a session (§6.3), and the persisted `resumeCursor`
 * is what makes the resumed turn continue the same conversation.
 *
 * A forked watcher — subscribed before the turn is dispatched, so an early
 * turn-end cannot slip past it — waits for the session to start running the
 * turn and then for the first `thread.session-set` where it leaves
 * `"running"`, releases the lease (marking the run `completed` on a clean end,
 * `failed` on an error), and terminates.

   *  1. While holding a position with a live strategy, arm a `pnl_above` watch
   *     at the strategy's declared profit target — the win worth banking. This
   *     runs in addition to the coverage logic, before it.
   *  2. The coverage floor: if the run left nothing that can fire on one of the
   *     two sides the mark can move — a price level, a PnL line, or a confirmed
   *     exchange stop — a reassessment is registered at the tight floor so the
   *     mission gets at least one more turn. A mission that *is* covered gets
   *     the slow sanity backstop instead, because it will be woken by a real
   *     event and a three-bar metronome only buys turns that conclude "hold".
   *     Both intervals scale with the strategy's primary timeframe.
   *
   * It never blocks the settlement. The lease is already released by the time
   * this runs, and a mission that could not be given a watch is still better
   * off settled with a logged warning than held open behind a bookkeeping
   * failure.
