/**
 * WatchEvaluator - evaluates persisted watches against live market data, spec §12.1.
 *
 * Two entry points feed it:
 *  - WS candle deliveries (one subscription per direct interval, §13) drive the
 *    `candle_close` watches.
 *  - A slow periodic sweep drives the `price_cross` watches (fresh BBO/mark via
 *    the gateway, whose §13 freshness windows apply) and fires
 *    `scheduled_reassessment` watches whose `runAt` has passed.
 *
 * On a match it flips the watch `active → triggered`, persists an inbox event
 * keyed for deduplication, and announces the firing on the orchestration stream
 * — the `TradingMissionReactor` turns that announcement into a
 * `TradingTurnCoordinator.requestRun`.
 *
 * "Fires exactly once" rests on two guards, both durable:
 *  - `markTriggered` only flips an `active` watch (atomic UPDATE), so a
 *    concurrent replay, supersede, or cancel drops the firing.
 *  - The inbox deduplication key is scoped per watch (`type:watchId:...`), so a
 *    replay after a restart cannot generate a second wake-up.
 *
 * The evaluator never starts a run itself; the turn coordinator owns the lease
 * and the wake path. A watch firing does not authorize a position (§12.4).
 *
 * @module WatchEvaluator
