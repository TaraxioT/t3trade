/**
 * TradingProtectionService — §17.2 steps 5–9, and the §17.3 / §17.4 repairs.
 *
 * One invariant, one implementation:
 *
 *   No acknowledged position increase may remain without confirmed
 *   exchange-native reduce-only protection beyond the bounded reconciliation
 *   window.
 *
 * Everything in §17 that places or repairs protection converges here, because
 * the three situations that break protection are the same situation wearing
 * different clothes: a partial fill (§17.3), a scale-in (§17.4), and a parent
 * cancellation that took its children with it (§17.1) all end with the
 * canonical position larger than the confirmed protected size. So the routine
 * is not "handle a partial fill" — it is "read the canonical position, read
 * the confirmed coverage, and close the gap", run after every one of them.
 *
 * Two rules shape the code more than anything else:
 *
 * A grouped response is not proof (§17.1). The submitted `normalTpsl` child
 * may be untriggered, rejected, or already cancelled, so nothing here trusts
 * what was sent. Coverage is read back from `frontendOpenOrders` every time.
 *
 * The replacement is confirmed before the old stop is dropped (§17.4). Placing
 * a correctly sized stop and cancelling the stale one is safe in that order
 * and unsafe in the other; overlapping reduce-only protection is harmless
 * because reduce-only orders cannot open exposure, while a gap between the
 * cancel and the placement is exactly the window the invariant forbids.
 *
 * When the window closes without confirmed coverage, this service does not
 * keep trying — it reports `escalate`, and §17.5's bounded emergency close
 * takes over.
 *
 * Alongside the stop invariant, `reconcileTakeProtection` retires what is
 * left of the retired server-side take-profit lane (plan 36 item 6 made the
 * target a wake, not an order): it withdraws any resting take-profit an
 * earlier build placed, and leftover reduce-only limits on a flat position.
 * It never places anything, never touches a stop, and never touches a
 * reduce-only order the harness rested itself (a `patient` exit — the caller
 * names those in `preserveCloids`).
