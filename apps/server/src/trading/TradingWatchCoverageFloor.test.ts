/**
 * The coverage floor at run settlement.
 *
 * A mission may not end a run holding a position with nothing armed that can
 * wake it. The failure this closes was observed live: a long open, one downside
 * `candle_close` armed, a `position_update` that correctly never fired because
 * the size never changed, price 25 points in favour, and a harness that was
 * never woken to take any of it.
 *
 * The same floor applies to a flat mission that has published a thesis: a
 * strategy whose triggers never come near the market would otherwise leave the
 * mission silent forever, which reads exactly like a mission that is working.
 *
 * The turn coordinator is what notices, because run settlement is the only
 * moment that knows a turn has finished deciding. These tests drive a real run
 * to its end — the test offers the turn-end event itself — and assert what the
 * mission is left holding.
