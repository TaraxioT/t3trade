/**
 * HyperliquidExecutionService unit tests — PROMPT-04 Task 11 (D2).
 *
 * Covers the §17.2 submit sequence's two retry/load-bearing guarantees:
 *
 *   1. Retry idempotency (§17.2 / §15.5): calling `submitOrder` twice with the
 *      same intent (same missionId + executionSequence + actionType ⇒ same
 *      idempotency_key + cloid) yields ONE execution record and ONE risk
 *      reservation. The second call reads the record back and returns it
 *      without re-signing or re-reserving. The exchange is submitted to exactly
 *      once (the recording fake asserts this).
 *
 *      Covered on the rejected path, the accepted path, and the unresolved
 *      `submitted` path — all three, because this guard is the ONLY thing
 *      between a retry and a duplicate position. Hyperliquid does not
 *      deduplicate on cloid for marketable IOCs (they never rest), so a retry
 *      that gets past the check fills a second time for real.
 *
 *   2. submitCancel (§16.4): with a recording fake exchange, calling
 *      `submitCancel` results in a signed action whose payload carries
 *      `cancels` (the cancel-by-cloid shape from OrderMapper).
 *
 * Layer assembly: the execution service's `make` pulls in the signer config,
 * the gateway, the preview service, the nonce coordinator, the exchange
 * client, and Crypto (for the execution-id UUID). The heavy/IO-bound deps
 * (gateway, preview, exchange) are stubbed; the nonce coordinator is live
 * (pure in-memory, no persist sink); the signer is armed directly via
 * `Layer.succeed` so the test does not depend on process.env; Crypto is
 * provided as the synchronous built-in. SQL is the in-memory sqlite layer,
 * migrated to 040 so the 038/039/040 execution tables + additive columns
 * exist.
