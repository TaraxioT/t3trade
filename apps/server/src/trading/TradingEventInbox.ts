/**
 * TradingEventInbox - persisted mission events with deduplication, spec §18.1.
 *
 * Observed facts are persisted as inbox events keyed for deduplication, then
 * claimed by the run that consumes them. An event moves
 * `pending → included_in_run → consumed`, so a queued event is never silently
 * lost and a run always sees the set it was started with.
 *
 * Deduplication is enforced by the `idx_trading_event_inbox_dedupe` unique
 * index (migration 035): a second persist with the same
 * `(missionId, deduplicationKey)` is ignored, so reconnects and replays cannot
 * generate a second wake-up.
