/**
 * TradingMarketChart — the chart surface's combined snapshot + candle read.
 *
 * The chart needs two things the exchange owns: the OHLC series a candle pane is
 * drawn from, and the mark/funding/OI/volume/change figures its header and
 * footer rows quote. Reading them as two separate RPCs would let the chart
 * render a price series against a stale header any time the two reads raced, so
 * this service fetches both in one effect and returns a single
 * `TradingMarketChartView` the surface can project atomically.
 *
 * The pair is cached for a few seconds because the chart is polled on a fixed
 * cadence: without the window every open workspace would put its own pair of
 * Hyperliquid calls on the wire on every poll, for figures that barely move in
 * that window. The TTL stays well under the candle poll so a polling client
 * still sees a fresh series each time, while concurrent clients share one read.
 *
 * A failed read never invents a chart. If either the snapshot or the history
 * call fails, the last good view is served again for a few minutes, marked
 * `stale`, and nothing new is written to cache; past that window, or with no
 * cache at all, the read yields `null` and the RPC fails. Blanking the whole
 * surface for one transient exchange hiccup is worse for an operator making an
 * exit decision than a chart a few seconds behind that says so.
 *
