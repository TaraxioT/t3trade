 * Level memory — plan 27 B1/B2.

 * What is worth pinning: events written at nearly-equal prices group into one
 * level under the ATR tolerance; the wakeup read is bounded and
 * nearest-to-the-mark first; writes are idempotent under replay; and the
 * structure-read echo returns the newest row for the preferred interval.
