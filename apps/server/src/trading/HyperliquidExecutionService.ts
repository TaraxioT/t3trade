/**
 * HyperliquidExecutionService — the submit sequence (§17.2 steps 1–5).
 *
 * This is the only code path that spends testnet capital. It runs the exact
 * order of operations:
 *
 *   1. resolve the interim signer (fail-closed if not armed)
 *   2. resolve market metadata (asset index) + fresh BBO
 *   3. run the §16.3 preview checklist
 *   4. map the order (IOC/GTC) with slippage + precision
 *   5. persist the execution record + risk reservation (before signing)
 *   6. sign in the serialized nonce lane
 *   7. POST /exchange
 *   8. inspect EVERY per-order status
 *   9. update the execution record with the result
 *
 * Retries reuse the same cloid + idempotency key (persisted before signing).
 * Idempotency is entirely local: the record is read back by idempotency key and
 * the retry is refused the moment that record shows the action already reached
 * the exchange. The exchange itself does NOT deduplicate — cloid uniqueness is
 * enforced only among *resting* orders, and a marketable IOC never rests, so a
 * resubmitted IOC opens a second order and fills again (verified live in
 * `packages/hyperliquid/src/executionLive.test.ts`).
