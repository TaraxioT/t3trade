/**
 * The lifetime of a `follow` subscription.
 *
 * `follow` runs three forked loops for one mission — fills, reconnects, and the
 * §18.2 #8 periodic backstop — and they live for as long as the scope they were
 * forked into. That is what lets the reactor retarget them when the active
 * mission changes, and it is what was missing when a revoked mission went on
 * polling the exchange for hours after a successor had taken over.
 *
 * These tests pin both halves: the periodic loop reconciles while the scope is
 * open, and stops the moment it closes.
