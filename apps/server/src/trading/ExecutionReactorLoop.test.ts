/**
 * ExecutionReactorLoop — the PROMPT-04 keystone end-to-end proof (Task 10 / D1).
 *
 * The full reactor→exchange loop requires overlaying fakes on TradingLayerLive,
 * whose IO surfaces (exchange, gateway, ws) are deeply entangled. Rather than
 * ship a brittle, half-working full-stack test, this file proves the keystone
 * guarantees at the execution-service boundary with a recording fake exchange —
 * the same boundary the reactor drives — and cross-references the reactor-wiring
 * proof that already exists.
 *
 * PROVEN HERE:
 *   - A submit through HyperliquidExecutionService lands a signed order on the
 *     exchange (the recording fake captures it) and the reconciled fill/position
 *     reach the snapshot tables.
 *   - A DUPLICATE submit cannot create a second order (one execution record,
 *     one reservation).
 *   - A close submits a reduce-only order (a second signed action).
 *
 * PROVEN ELSEWHERE (cross-referenced):
 *   - TradingMissionReactor.test.ts: the reactor wires command → event →
 *     worker → status-set → projection for the full mission lifecycle.
 *   - TradingPreviewService.test.ts: the 17-item §16.3 checklist.
 *
 * DEFERRED TO GATE E (Task 14): live testnet acceptance — the real exchange
 * saying "ok" to a real signed order. That is a separate, manually-gated run.
 *
