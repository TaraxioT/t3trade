/**
 * Applies requested trading intents to the domain, then reports what happened.
 *
 * The decider turns a client's control into a `*-requested` event, which is a
 * question, not an answer. This reactor is what answers it: it runs the write
 * through `TradingMissionService` — where §11.1 and the one-active-mission
 * invariant are enforced — and only then dispatches the internal
 * `trading.mission.status-set` command whose event the projector reads.
 *
 * That ordering is the whole point. The UI never sees a status the domain
 * refused, and mission state still reaches clients over T3's ordered WS push
 * path rather than a side channel.
 *
 * The reactor also closes the PROMPT-03 wake loop: a `trading.mission-watch-fired`
 * domain event (announced by the WatchEvaluator) is turned into a
 * `TradingTurnCoordinator.requestRun`, resuming the bound provider session.
