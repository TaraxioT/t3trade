/**
 * Publishing a plan, and everything an accepted publish drags behind it.
 *
 * `TradingStrategyService.publishPlan` writes the row. It does not announce the
 * publish to the workspace, it does not reconcile the exchange to the plan it
 * just accepted, and it does not withdraw the resting entry the previous plan
 * left working. Those three were assembled inside the `trading_plan` MCP
 * handler, which made them the model's path and only the model's path.
 *
 * Plan 29 step 8.4 gives the operator a second way to revise a plan — dragging
 * a level on the chart is a `plan()` revision — and a drag that called
 * `publishPlan` alone would move the stop on screen and not on Hyperliquid.
 * So the whole sequence lives here, and both callers get all of it.
