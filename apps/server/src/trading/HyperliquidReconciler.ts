/**
 * HyperliquidReconciler — converges local state to canonical exchange state

 * Hyperliquid is the canonical source of market and account truth. Local
 * records (fills, position snapshots, open orders) are hints until canonical
 * account/order/position state confirms them. This service reads canonical
 * state via the master-wallet address and upserts the migration-037 tables so
 * the projection and loss-budget accounting reflect reconciled truth.
 *
 * The eight triggers (§18.2): at server startup, after WebSocket reconnect,
 * before execution, after submission, after each fill, after position updates,
 * before resuming a paused mission, and periodically while a position is open.
 * Each is a named entry point that funnels into `reconcile`.

// reviews, level memory, external-change classification. A manual pass has no

// began on the market, and the settlement of manual execution records and
// their reservations. D4 exclusivity is what makes the market-scoped read
// attributable: while manual authority holds a market, no mission trades it.
//
// A standalone function rather than a second service method: the reconciler
// service's construction deliberately captures only the mission-storytelling
// dependencies, and the manual pass needs none of them.
