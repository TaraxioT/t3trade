/**
 * TradingEmergencyCloseService — the bounded emergency close (§17.5).
 *
 * Invoked when full protection cannot be confirmed inside the reconciliation
 * window. §17.5 is emphatic that this is "a deterministic safety action, not a
 * strategy decision": it runs without the harness, in a fixed order, a fixed
 * number of times, and it never waits for anyone to wake up and help.
 *
 * The order is the specification, and each step exists because of the failure
 * it prevents:
 *
 *   1. Mark the mission blocked and block all position increases — otherwise
 *      the thing being unwound can grow while it is being unwound.
 *   2. Cancel mission-owned non-reduce-only orders — a resting entry that
 *      fills mid-close re-opens the exposure just closed. Reduce-only orders
 *      are deliberately left alone: they are the protection.
 *   3. Read fresh canonical position and BBO — the size closed must be the
 *      size that exists now, not the size that existed when the trouble
 *      started.
 *   4. Submit a reduce-only marketable IOC for that size.
 *   5. Reconcile fills and the remaining position.
 *   6. Retry with a FRESH read and the REMAINING size, at most three attempts
 *      in total. An IOC fills what it can and cancels the rest, so a partial
 *      close is the expected case, not an error.
 *   7. If a position still remains: keep the mission blocked, preserve
 *      whatever protection can be placed, and report the exact remaining size
 *      and reason.
 *
 * The bound is what makes this safe to run deterministically. An unbounded
 * retry loop against a market that will not take the size is a way to keep
 * paying fees forever; three attempts and an honest "here is what is left" is
 * the behaviour §17.5 asks for.
