/**
 * TradingMarketChart unit tests.
 *
 * The contract this service owns is the cache window and the "either read fails
 * yields null, nothing cached" rule — both rest on the gateway read pair and the
 * `Clock.currentTimeMillis` TTL, so the tests drive a stub gateway and a
 * `TestClock`. The view-mapping case also pins the candle/field projection.
 *
 * Each case provides its own `TradingMarketChartLive` so the in-memory `Ref`
 * cache starts empty per test (a shared layer would leak cache state across
 * cases, defeating the cache-window assertions).
