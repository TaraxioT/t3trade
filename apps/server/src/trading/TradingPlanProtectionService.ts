/**
 * TradingPlanProtectionService — plan 29 step 4.5: the plan writes protection.
 *
 * The plan is the position's declared state; writing it reconciles the
 * exchange to it. The reactor's watchdog converges stop coverage to the
 * CURRENT plan every ~5s; this service is the immediate half, run from the
 * publish aftermath so the stop moves at publish time rather than a watchdog
 * pass later. This is why a separate `protect` tool is unnecessary.
 *
 * Division of labour with the watchdog, stated once:
 * - Target side: the target is a wake, never a resting order (plan 36 item
 *   6). Both this and `guardTakeProfit` run the same
 *   `reconcileTakeProtection`, whose only remaining job is withdrawing
 *   take-profits an older build rested.
 * - Stop side: this service MOVES the resting stop to the plan's stop price,
 *   inside the hard constraint below. `guardProtection` remains the coverage
 *   backstop — it re-places a stop that vanished, at the last price anyone
 *   set, and never widens anything.
 *
 * HARD CONSTRAINTS (risk gates, not preferences), both in `planStopRefusal`:
 * a plan-driven stop must be on the losing side of the mark — one on the
 * winning side triggers the instant it rests and closes the position at market
 * — and it may tighten freely but must not widen the position's planned loss
 * beyond the approved per-position envelope (the entry record's
 * planned-loss-at-stop, else the plan's own `stop.maximumPlannedLossUsd`). A
 * revision that fails either leaves the exchange stop exactly where it is and
 * says so in the outcome, so the publish response can carry it back to the
 * model (which still has `trading_exit`'s guarded `move_stop` path).

 * and the reason `trading_exit`'s `move_stop` refuses `wrong_side`. Publishing moves
 * the stop now, so it answers to that gate too.
 *
 * SECOND, the envelope: a move may tighten freely but must not widen the
 * planned loss past what was approved.
 *
 * When no approval can be read, the stop currently resting stands in for one.
 * "We could not read what you approved" must not mean "so anything goes" on a
 * live position — but it must not wedge either, because the watchdog's repair
 * path runs through here and a position with no readable approval still needs
 * its protection restored. Falling back to the resting stop does both: every
 * tightening and every repair goes through, and only a widening is refused,
 * against the only ceiling still knowable.
