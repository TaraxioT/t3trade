/**
 * TradingMissionSweep - the boot-time purge of missions with no thread left.
 *
 * Settled missions are kept (plan 27 H1): a terminal row is the permanent
 * record of what was traded, and deleting it destroyed exactly the data the
 * stop-placement and calibration measurements need. What still goes is the
 * orphan — a mission whose thread was deleted out from under it. Nothing can
 * wake it, nothing can settle it, no surface can ever show it, and a
 * non-terminal orphan holds the one active-mission slot.
 *
 * Runs at boot, only while flat. Kept rather than made a one-off migration
 * because it is idempotent and cheap: on a clean database it finds nothing.
