 * Level event history — plan 27 B1.

 * A mission used to meet every price level as if for the first time: a
 * boundary that had already broken twice, or already stopped this mission
 * out, read exactly like a fresh one. These helpers are the memory. The write
 * seams (watch registration, the watch evaluator, the fill reconciler) append
 * one row per observed fact; the wakeup composer reads them back grouped into
 * levels with an ATR-scaled tolerance and bounded to the levels nearest the
 * mark.
 *
 * Plain functions over `SqlClient` rather than a service, so the seams that
 * write them — some of which are built before the service layers — can call
 * them without new layer wiring. Event ids are deterministic
 * (`mission:kind:time:level`), so a replayed reconcile or a re-delivered
 * candle records the same fact once.
