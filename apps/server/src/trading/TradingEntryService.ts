/**
 * TradingEntryService — one entry, priced, sized and pre-checked, from what the
 * harness can actually name.
 *
 * Executing used to ask for eight things a language model cannot know: the
 * current strategy version, the current authority version, the id of the
 * harness run holding the decision lease, a monotonic execution sequence, a
 * limit price that crosses the book, a size inside four separate ceilings, a
 * planned loss consistent with that size and stop, and precision the exchange
 * accepts. Every one of them is a refusal when it is wrong, and all eight are
 * things the server already knows.
 *
 * This is the server answering them. The harness names a market, a side, a
 * stop, and optionally a size; this reads the mission, the lease, the book, the
 * account and the budget, derives the rest, and runs the same §16.3 preview the
 * execution will run. What comes back is the intent, ready to submit.
 *
 * Nothing is persisted as a token and nothing is handed to the harness to hand
 * back (plan 29 step 6.2). The two-step existed so the harness could see the
 * size and price before committing, but the only thing it could DO with them
 * was execute — and the wait between the halves was four more ways to fail:
 * an expired quote, a lease that moved on, a mission mismatch, a token that
 * was never cut. The sizing travels out with the outcome instead, which is
 * where a harness needs it: sizing the NEXT decision.
 *
 * Symmetric with `TradingExitService.prepare` on purpose — both hand the
 * caller a ready intent with the versions and the lease it must execute
 * against, and both refuse in the same shape.
 *
 * @module TradingEntryService
