 * `evaluateLossBudget` (in trading-contracts) is pure; it takes already-
 * reconciled inputs. This reader is the single place that gathers those
 * inputs for one mission: realised PnL + paid fees from `trading_fills`,
 * open-position risk from `trading_position_snapshots`, pending-entry
 * risk from `trading_risk_reservations`, and the notional of the accepted,
 * unfilled resting entries the aggregate exposure caps count. The reactor
 * and preview both call it so the budget they enforce is the same budget
 * the reconciler wrote.
 *
 * Local tables are themselves reconciled truth (the reconciler wrote them
 * from canonical exchange state), so reading here does not violate "local
 * state never outranks Hyperliquid" — the reconciler is what made them
 * canonical.
