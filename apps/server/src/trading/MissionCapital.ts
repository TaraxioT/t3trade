/**
 * Where a mission's `allocatedCapitalUsd` comes from.
 *
 * The mandate scales from one number: `testnetAuthorityDefaults` derives gross
 * notional, the cumulative loss budget, and per-position risk from it. That
 * number used to be a constant — 50 — which on a 1,000 USDC testnet account
 * boxed the harness into a $400 notional ceiling and a $17.50 loss budget
 * nobody had chosen. So it is resolved from the account instead.
 *
 * The order, and why:
 *
 *   1. An explicit grant (the env knob, or a number typed into the form) wins
 *      verbatim. It is never clamped against the balance in either direction:
 *      an operator who writes 5,000 against a 1,000 account is stating a
 *      mandate, not asking for advice, and the mandate is theirs to state.
 *   2. Otherwise the live `accountValue` at creation time.
 *   3. Otherwise `FALLBACK_MISSION_CAPITAL_USD`, with a warning.
 *
 * An unreadable snapshot logs and falls through rather than failing the
 * creation. The balance here is information, not a gate — a dead info endpoint
 * must not be the thing that stops a testnet lab from starting, and the warning
 * is the operator's cue that the mandate is smaller than they expect.
 *
 * Resolution happens once, at creation. The mandate does not re-scale when the
 * balance moves: the harness sees the balance every wakeup through
 * `accountSnapshot` and sizes within the rails itself, while the rails are the
 * operator's grant and stay put until the operator changes them.
