/**
 * TradingWorkingOrderService — plan 29 step 2.4.
 *
 * The properties worth proving are about ordering and identity: that a
 * replacement only ever goes out after the old order is confirmed GONE (two
 * resting entries are double exposure), that the replacement carries the
 * approved size/side/stop and nothing else, that the wait accumulates through
 * re-prices instead of resetting, and that every terminal outcome says so in
 * one line the reactor can hand the model.
 *
 * The exchange is a small state machine (a position, a book, a set of resting
 * orders) and the records table is a real in-memory SQLite, because the loop
 * derives its state from both — a stub on either side could not distinguish
 * "re-priced at the near side" from "re-placed at the stale price".
