/**
 * TradingExecutionGuard unit tests — §16.4 exhaustion enforcement.
 *
 * This file tests the REAL `TradingExecutionGuard` service (not a local
 * re-implementation of the guard logic). The service is constructed via its
 * live layer, with stub (no-op) services for its three dependencies
 * (TradingMissionService, HyperliquidExecutionService, HyperliquidReconciler).
 *
 * `guardAction` and `guardResume` do not touch SQL or the gateway — they
 * decide purely from the supplied `TradingLossBudget` / `isBlocked` flag — so
 * the stubs are sufficient and the real enforcement code path is exercised.
 *
 * `blockForExhaustion` and `reduceOnlyClose` require the full layer (SQL +
 * gateway stubs + a reconciled state machine) and are covered end-to-end by
 * ExecutionReactorLoop.test.ts; they are skipped here rather than reimplemented
 * locally.
