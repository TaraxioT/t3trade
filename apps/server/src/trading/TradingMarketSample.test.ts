/**
 * The previous observation's market sample — plan 29 steps 7.3 and 7.4.
 *
 * What is worth pinning: one row per mission and market, overwritten rather
 * than accumulated; the optional halves survive a round trip as absent rather
 * than as zero; and neither side can fail an observation — a read against a
 * table that is not there returns nothing, and a write against it is a no-op.
