/**
 * The decision funnel: one typed terminal decision per harness run, plus the
 * observed facts it was derived from.
 *
 * Before this, the only durable evidence a turn left behind was what it
 * changed: a published strategy, an execution record, a refusal in the inbox. A
 * turn that changed nothing left nothing, so the most common outcome in the
 * system — no trade — was also the least measurable one. This module records
 * the rest of the funnel: which tools a run called, which of them failed,
 * whether it published, whether it tried to execute, what the gate said, and
 * what the exchange said.
 *
 * It is a set of functions over `SqlClient` rather than a service, so the three
 * places that observe a run (the MCP tool boundary, the reactor's execution
 * paths, and the coordinator's lease release) can call it with the `sql` they
 * already hold, without another layer to wire through every test.
 *
 * Nothing here stores model reasoning. Tool names are public, and
 * `first_tool_error` is an error message the tool already returned to the
 * agent.
