/**
 * TradingExitService — the server half of getting out.
 *
 * The mirror of `TradingEntryService`, and for the same reason: an exit is made
 * of a strategy version, an authority version, a lease-owning run, a monotonic
 * sequence, a crossing limit price, a side and a size, and the harness can
 * usefully answer none of them. The side and size in particular have exactly
 * one correct source — the canonical position — and taking them from an intent
 * instead is how a `reduce` becomes an increase wearing a reduce's name.
 *
 * Unlike a quote, an exit is not held for later. It resolves against state read
 * now and is handed straight to the execution path, because the whole point of
 * these three tools is that there is nothing between deciding to get out and
 * getting out.
 *
