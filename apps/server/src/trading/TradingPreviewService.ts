/**
 * trading_preview_order — the §16.3 position-increase checklist, in order.
 *
 * Before any position-increasing action is signed, T3 runs the checklist from
 * risk §16.3 in its listed order — 14 of its 17 rows: the three discipline
 * rows (strategy version, authority version, entry-side market mandate) were
 * retired by plan-29 §3.3. Every item has a rejection reason; a rejection
 * test pins each. Risk is reserved BEFORE signing and reconciled after every
 * state change.
 *
 * This service is pure validation over already-loaded state. It reads no
 * exchange and mutates no tables — it returns either the validated preview
 * (with the reservation it requires) or the first failing reason. The
 * execution service reserves the risk and persists the record only after a
 * successful preview.

// authority; `exchange_minimum_met` refused a dust position that is precisely
// the position you cannot leave sitting there; and the budget item refused the
// action that STOPS the bleeding because the bleeding had used the budget up.
//
// None of those rules is wrong about entries. They are simply about entries.
// The exit list below keeps every check that is about whether this exit can be
// executed correctly, and drops every check that is about whether more exposure
// should be permitted.

// itself: `strategy_version_current`, `authority_version_current` and the
// entry half of `market_is_eth` were permission and discipline ceremony — was
// the model obeying its own bookkeeping? — not questions about whether the
// order itself is correct. Every check about the order — size, leverage, loss,
// wallet, freshness, concurrency, the stop — is exactly where it was.

// --- the manual checklist (final-form Phase 7) ------------------------------
//
// A manual order has no mission, no plan, no lease, and no harness — so the
// four items that interrogate them (`mission_active`, `entries_allowed`,
// `harness_run_owns_lease`, `direction_permitted`) have no question to ask.
// Everything that is about the ORDER stays: the armed signer, freshness, size
// and price, the exchange minimum, the mandatory stop, and the in-flight
// conflict. The mandate ceilings are replaced by the account envelope
// (`AccountTradingPolicy`): gross notional against the account's position cap,
// leverage against the account's leverage cap, planned loss against the
// per-trade budget. Margin capacity and the sizing arithmetic run in
// `TradingManualEntryService` through `deriveFeasibleSize`, exactly as the
// mission path runs them before ITS preview.
