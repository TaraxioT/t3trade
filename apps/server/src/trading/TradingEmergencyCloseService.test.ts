/**
 * TradingEmergencyCloseService — §17.5.
 *
 * The properties worth proving here are all about boundedness and ordering:
 * that a partial IOC fill converges inside three attempts, that a market which
 * will not take the size stops at three rather than retrying forever, that the
 * failure path still reports the exact remaining size, and that the reduce-only
 * protection is never among the orders cancelled on the way out.
 *
 * The fake exchange fills a fixed fraction of whatever is asked, which is what
 * a marketable IOC does against a thin book — the case §17.5 step 6 exists for.
