/**
 * StaleSessionReconciler - clear sessions that outlived the process.
 *
 * A provider session lives in this process: the CLI child, the SDK query, the
 * event pump. Nothing survives a restart, and nothing is resumed eagerly at
 * boot. So a projected session still reading `starting` or `running` after the
 * server comes up is describing work that no longer exists — the last thing
 * that happened was the process going away before the adapter could emit
 * `session.exited`, which is the ordinary outcome of a crash, a `node --watch`
 * reload, or a quit mid-turn.
 *
 * Left alone the thread is stuck: the composer stays blocked, the sidebar
 * counts "Working for 57m", and the only way out is settling the thread. This
 * reconciler dispatches the same `thread.session.set` the adapter would have
 * sent, which settles the running turns and clears the pending turn start
 * through the normal projection path.
 *
